## drawback

Today carpooling is mainly managed via WhatsApp and Telegram groups.
Is it the best way to operate ? Absolutly not ! 
We can notice the following problems :

- not safe
- inconfortable to user
- number of members/group is limited (e.g. 257 max for WhatsApp)
- each group relevant to **one** city/location 

## Solution

With **Carpool-U**, we propose an application more targeted and intuitive for users.

- Elaborate for students and university staff.
- Safer
- In bref, we are bringing an solution to each problems found in current management of carpooling. 
 
let's explore Carpool-U implementation !
